Environmental factors like **infrasound** and **Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)** are primarily documented to cause **non-specific psychological and physiological stress responses** rather than specific psychiatric symptoms like psychosis.

These effects are largely due to **chronic environmental annoyance, discomfort, or the psychological stress resulting from a belief in their harmfulness.**

## 👂 Effects of Infrasound and Low-Frequency Noise

Infrasound (sound below $20\text{ Hz}$) and Low-Frequency Noise (LFN, $20\text{ Hz}$ to $200\text{ Hz}$) are often inaudible or barely audible but can be perceived as pressure or vibration. The psychological effects are largely mediated by the body's stress response to this perceived annoyance or disturbance.

### 1. Stress and Annoyance
* **Annoyance and Irritability:** The most common effect is severe **annoyance** and **irritability**, particularly from LFN, which can penetrate structures easily and is difficult to mask.
* **Chronic Stress:** Long-term exposure to LFN is a known environmental stressor that triggers a **chronic stress response**, leading to elevated cortisol levels.

### 2. Sleep Disturbances
* **Insomnia:** Infrasound and LFN are strongly linked to **sleep disturbance** because they can penetrate buildings and cause physical discomfort or be subconsciously processed as a threat, even if not consciously heard.
* **Fatigue:** Resultant poor sleep quality leads to chronic daytime fatigue and reduced cognitive function.

### 3. Non-Specific Physical Symptoms
Since infrasound can stimulate the **vestibular system** (balance) and cause physical vibrations, people often report:
* **Headaches and Migraines**
* **Tinnitus** (ringing in the ears)
* **Dizziness and Vertigo**
* **Feelings of Pressure** in the chest or head.

### 4. Psychological Distress
* **Anxiety and Mood Changes:** The combination of chronic sleep deprivation, annoyance, and physical discomfort significantly contributes to **anxiety, restlessness, and depressed mood**. This general state of distress can lower the threshold for other conditions, including the exacerbation of Auditory Hallucinations (AH) in vulnerable individuals.

## ⚡️ Effects of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)

For common, low-level environmental EMF exposure (like from cell towers or Wi-Fi), the documented psychological effects are primarily attributed to **psychological factors** rather than a direct biological influence on the brain.

### 1. Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS)
* The primary condition linked to EMF concern is **Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS)**. It is characterized by non-specific symptoms that the affected person **attributes to EMF exposure.**
* The World Health Organization (WHO) and major medical bodies note that EHS is **not recognized as a medical diagnosis** and that symptoms are not correlated with actual EMF exposure levels in blinded studies.

### 2. Psychological Distress and Anxiety
* **Nocebo Effect:** The psychological symptoms are largely driven by the **nocebo effect**—a negative placebo effect. The strong belief or fear that EMF is harmful induces real symptoms of stress and anxiety.
* **Health Anxiety:** People reporting EHS often experience intense **health anxiety** focused on the belief that they are being poisoned or harmed by invisible fields. This can become debilitating and severely restrict their daily life (e.g., avoiding public places, devices, or areas with perceived high EMF).
* **Sleep Problems:** Similar to infrasound, preoccupation and anxiety over EMF sources can lead to significant **insomnia** and related fatigue.

### 3. Neurophysiological Studies (High/Pulsed Fields)
* In controlled, high-intensity laboratory settings, specifically **pulsed magnetic fields** (not continuous low-level exposure) can be used therapeutically in protocols like **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**.
    * **TMS** is used to treat **Major Depressive Disorder** and can temporarily induce changes in mood, cognition, and motor function by directly stimulating or inhibiting targeted brain areas.
* This demonstrates that magnetic fields *can* affect the brain, but it is at highly concentrated, focused, and non-environmental levels.

## ⚖️ The Diathesis-Stress Model Connection

The crucial link to severe symptoms like AH/AVH relies on the **diathesis-stress model**. 

* **Diathesis (Vulnerability):** An underlying biological or psychological predisposition (e.g., genetic vulnerability to psychosis, trauma history).
* **Environmental Factor (Stress):** Chronic exposure to infrasound annoyance or the chronic anxiety over perceived EMF harm.
* **Outcome:** These environmental stressors act as the **trigger** that interacts with the pre-existing vulnerability, leading to the **onset or exacerbation** of a psychotic episode, depression, or an increase in the frequency of hallucinations. The environmental factor does not *cause* the complex hallucination but rather creates the stressful condition that allows the underlying vulnerability to surface.
