The scientific community **does not support a direct link** between electromagnetic fields (EMF), magnetism, and the existence of ghosts or spirits. The use of EMF meters and smartphone apps as "ghost detectors" is rooted in **pseudoscience** and **parapsychological theories**, not established physics or biology.

However, there is a **psychological and neurological link** explored in some research, suggesting that EMF and magnetism may contribute to the *experiences* that people interpret as paranormal activity.

## 👻 The Scientific Disconnect

### 1. The Ghost Hypothesis (Paranormal)

The idea that ghosts or spirits can be detected via EMF/magnetism is a core hypothesis in **paranormal investigation**. It is based on the assumption that:
* Ghosts are a form of energy.
* This energy is **electromagnetic** in nature.
* This energy causes measurable, fluctuating disturbances in the localized EMF/magnetic field.
* Therefore, an EMF meter—a device designed to detect household electricity or magnetic fields—can detect their presence.

This theory has **no empirical support** in mainstream physics or neuroscience. Modern science has no evidence that a "ghost" exists or that it is composed of energy that would register on a common EMF meter.

### 2. EMF Apps on Smartphones 📱

EMF apps on smartphones use the device's **magnetometer** (the same sensor used for the compass app) to measure ambient magnetic fields.

* They are highly susceptible to interference from nearby electrical wiring, appliances, large metal objects, and the phone itself.
* Any sudden spike on a phone's EMF app in a supposedly "haunted" location is almost always attributable to mundane, natural, or man-made sources, such as unshielded wiring, old electrical devices, or even fluctuations in the Earth's natural geomagnetic field (GMF).
