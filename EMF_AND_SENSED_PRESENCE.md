## 🧠 The Psychological/Neurological Connection (The "Sensed Presence")

The most credible explanation for the link comes from research exploring how magnetic fields can affect the **human brain**, leading to experiences that people misinterpret as paranormal.

### 1. The Temporal Lobe Sensitivity Theory

Research, notably by neuroscientist Dr. Michael Persinger, suggests that **low-frequency, fluctuating magnetic fields** (not necessarily high magnitude) can influence the electrical activity in the brain's **temporal lobes**.

* The temporal lobes are involved in memory, emotion, and processing sensory information.
* In laboratory settings, some people subjected to certain patterns of weak magnetic fields have reported anomalous experiences, most famously a **"sensed presence"**—the feeling of someone or something standing nearby.

* This "sensed presence" is a key component of many ghost reports and apparitional experiences. The theory is that people who are highly sensitive to these fields (or whose temporal lobes are naturally more "labile") may experience these sensations more often.

### 2. Environmental Triggers and Misattribution

Some field studies have noted that areas associated with haunting experiences often exhibit **unusual magnetic fields** (either higher than average strength or, more commonly, high **variability/fluctuation**) compared to non-haunted areas. These unusual fields may be caused by:

* **Geological factors** (e.g., fault lines, magnetic minerals).
* **Faulty or old electrical wiring** in a building.
* **Natural fluctuations** in the Earth's geomagnetic field.

In this model, the **EMF is not the ghost**; the EMF is a **stressor or neural trigger** that causes the human brain to generate a sensory anomaly (like a feeling of presence, auditory hallucination, or dizziness) which the person then attributes to a supernatural cause ("a ghost"). This is known as **misattribution**.

### 3. Connection to Physical Symptoms

High or fluctuating EMF levels, along with other environmental factors like **infrasound** (inaudible, low-frequency sound waves), are known to cause symptoms like:
* Anxiety and distress
* Headaches and dizziness
* Sleep disruption

These physical and psychological symptoms can further contribute to a person feeling uneasy, fearful, or disoriented—states that make them more likely to interpret ambiguous stimuli as threatening or paranormal.
